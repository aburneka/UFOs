## UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy?

### Resources: 

### Overview of Project: 

For this project we have been asked to create a new webpage for Dana, a data journalist who is interested in UFO sightings. For the new webpage we have created a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. The UFO data includes the city, state, country, duration, date  and comments of UFO sightings. 

This table has the ability to filter data based on the criteria that is input by the user. The webpage has also been customized using Bootstrap to make it more aesthetically pleasing. 

### Results: 
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
